Question 1: Keywords in Python ? ==>  
Keyword are reserved words that have pre define meaning in python language. These words can't be use as variable, function name and
identifier. For example: if, else, for, with, def, del, import, from, with, while and many more.

Question 2:  Namespaces and Scope in Python ==>  
Namespaces are use to uniquly identify an object in Python. For example: a same name of diffrent objects may located in many places
we can't identify actual object for this purpose we use namespaces.
lifetime or access of an object called scope in python.
	
Question 3: Statement, Indentation and Comment in Python ==>  
Set of instructions (source code) given to computer for execution called statements.
A tab use for seperate a special type of statements called intentation. For example: A tab after if else or loop conditios.
comments are extra line of text that can't execute. This is use for increase program readability.

Question 4: Structuring Python Programs ==>
Structuring of python program is use for make code readable and simple understandable. Use less line of code instead of more lines. 

Question 5: How to check if a string is a valid keyword in Python? ==>  
We can easily check a string is a valid keyword or not by using keyword library. => keyword.iskeyword(var)

Question 6: How to assign values to variables in Python and other languages ==>  
We can assign a value to a variable in python and other languages in same way. => x=45

Question 7: How to print without newline in Python? ==>  
We can print a output without newline by using "end" parameter in print function.

Question 8: Decision making ==>  
If else are use for decision making in python. If condition is true then if block will be execute otherwise else block execute.

Question 9: Basic calculator program using Python ==>  
We can easily make a Calculater program using python. You can check .py file..

Question 10: Python Language advantages and applications ==>  
Python gives us many advantages on other programming languages. It has siple syntax.It is a high level language have user friendly
data structures.Python is an Object-oriented language it has ability of Portable across to operating systems etc..
Python is use in Web frameworks and applications, Enterprise and Business applications, developing Operating Systems, Education,
it is very compatible with Databases and is is also use in Software Development.

Question 11: Taking input in Python ==>  
In python 3.x we use input() function to take input from user. But in 2.x we use raw_input() function for input.

Question 12: Taking input from console in Python ==>  
We can easily take input from console in python by using input() function. But here we can't write string in inside input function

Question 13: Taking multiple inputs from user in Python ==> 
We can take multiple inputs in python by using split() function with print() function. Other then we take multiple inputs in a list
using loop. 
	
Question 14: Python Input Methods for Competitive Programming ==>  
We can do this by using stdin() method from sys library. We can write a extra function only for taking input from user.

Question 15: Vulnerability in input() function â€“ Python 2.x ==>  
In python 2.x two functions are use for taking input that is raw_input() and input(). There is a vulnerability in input() function. we
can enter a function name or invalid input instead of require input. Here we can access variables by using input() function.

Question 16: Python | Output using print() function ==>  
For output we use print() function in python. print("This a print function")

Question 17: How to print without newline in Python? ==>  
for this purpose we use end parameter at the end of print() function.

Question 18: Python | end parameter in print() ==>  
Python end parameter is use to print without newline.

Question 19: Python | sep parameter in print() ==>  
sep parameter use in print() function to separate values from one another with diffrent symbols and spaces.

Question 20: Python | Output Formatting ==>  
There are many ways in python for formatting output. we can use "string modulo operator %" , using formate method with print(),
rjust(), ljust, center and f string........
